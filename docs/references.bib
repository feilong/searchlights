    abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification can rival and even exceed human-level performance. The relationships between internal representations learned by DCNNs and those of the primate face processing system are not well understood, especially in naturalistic settings. We developed the largest naturalistic dynamic face stimulus set in human neuroimaging research (700+ naturalistic video clips of unfamiliar faces) to investigate this problem. DCNN representational geometries were weakly but significantly correlated with neural response geometries across the human face processing system. Intermediate layers better matched visual, face-selective cortices, and behavioral similarity judgments than the final fully-connected layers. Our results showed DCNNs captured only a small amount of the rich information in the neural representations during naturalistic face viewing. Future artificial neural networks trained with more ecological objective functions may help advance artificial intelligence toward the ultimate goal of mimicking human intelligence in naturalistic, real-world scenarios.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

    abstract = {A major challenge for systems neuroscience is to break the neural code. Computational algorithms for encoding information into neural activity and extracting information from measured activity afford understanding of how percepts, memories, thought, and knowledge are represented in patterns of brain activity. The past decade and a half has seen significant advances in the development of methods for decoding human neural activity, such as multivariate pattern classification, representational similarity analysis, hyperalignment, and stimulus-model-based encoding and decoding. This article reviews these advances and integrates neural decoding methods into a common framework organized around the concept of high-dimensional representational spaces.

    abstract = {The development of high-resolution neuroimaging and multielectrode electrophysiological recording provides neuroscientists with huge amounts of multivariate data. The complexity of the data creates a need for statistical summary, but the local averaging standardly applied to this end may obscure the effects of greatest neuroscientific interest. In neuroimaging, for example, brain mapping analysis has focused on the discovery of activation, i.e., of extended brain regions whose average activity changes across experimental conditions. Here we propose to ask a more general question of the data: Where in the brain does the activity pattern contain information about the experimental condition? To address this question, we propose scanning the imaged volume with a "searchlight," whose contents are analyzed multivariately at each location in the brain.},

    abstract = {For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has been shown to be a sensitive method to detect areas that encode certain stimulus dimensions. By moving a searchlight through the volume of the brain, one can continuously map the information content about the experimental conditions of interest to the brain. Traditionally, the searchlight is defined as a volume sphere that does not take into account the anatomy of the cortical surface. Here we present a method that uses a cortical surface reconstruction to guide voxel selection for information mapping. This approach differs in two important aspects from a volume-based searchlight definition. First, it uses only voxels that are classified as grey matter based on an anatomical scan. Second, it uses a surface-based geodesic distance metric to define neighbourhoods of voxels, and does not select voxels across a sulcus. We study here the influence of these two factors onto classification accuracy and onto the spatial specificity of the resulting information map. In our example data set, participants pressed one of four fingers while undergoing fMRI. We used MVPA to identify regions in which local fMRI patterns can successfully discriminate which finger was moved. We show that surface-based information mapping is a more sensitive measure of local information content, and provides better spatial selectivity. This makes surface-based information mapping a useful technique for a data-driven analysis of information representation in the cerebral cortex. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

    abstract = {Local voxel patterns of fMRI signals contain specific information about cognitive processes ranging from basic sensory processing to high level decision making. These patterns can be detected using multivariate pattern classification, and localization of these patterns can be achieved with searchlight methods in which the information content of spherical sub-volumes of the fMRI signal is assessed. The only assumption made by this approach is that the patterns are spatially local. We present a cortical surface-based searchlight approach to pattern localization. Voxels are grouped according to distance along the cortical surface—the intrinsic metric of cortical anatomy—rather than Euclidean distance as in volumetric searchlights. Using a paradigm in which the category of visually presented objects is decoded, we compare the surface-based method to a standard volumetric searchlight technique. Group analyses of accuracy maps produced by both methods show similar distributions of informative regions. The surface-based method achieves a finer spatial specificity with comparable peak values of significance, while the volumetric method appears to be more sensitive to small informative regions and might also capture information not located directly within the gray matter. Furthermore, our findings show that a surface centered in the middle of the gray matter contains more information than to the white–gray boundary or the pial surface.},

Current models of the functional architecture of human cortex emphasize areas that capture coarse-scale features of cortical topography but provide no account for population responses that encode information in fine-scale patterns of activity. Here, we present a linear model of shared representational spaces in human cortex that captures fine-scale distinctions among population responses with response-tuning basis functions that are common across brains and models cortical patterns of neural responses with individual-specific topographic basis functions. We derive a common model space for the whole cortex using a new algorithm, searchlight hyperalignment, and complex, dynamic stimuli that provide a broad sampling of visual, auditory, and social percepts. The model aligns representations across brains in occipital, temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as shown by between-subject multivariate pattern classification and intersubject correlation of representational geometry, indicating that structural principles for shared neural representations apply across widely divergent domains of information. The model provides a rigorous account for individual variability of well-known coarse-scale topographies, such as retinotopy and category selectivity, and goes further to account for fine-scale patterns that are multiplexed with coarse-scale topographies and carry finer distinctions.},

We created a high-dimensional common model of the human connectome to search for fine-scale structure that is shared across brains. Projecting individual connectivity data into this new common model connectome accounts for substantially more variance in the human connectome than do previous models. This newly discovered shared structure is closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal a shared fine-scale structure that is a major component of the human connectome that coexists with coarse-scale, areal structure. This shared fine-scale structure was not captured in previous models and was, therefore, inaccessible to analysis and study.},

As a result, individual differences in cortical functional architecture are confounded by topographic idiosyncrasies—i.e., differences in functional–anatomical correspondence. In this study, we used hyperalignment to align information encoded in topographically variable patterns to study individual differences in fine-grained cortical functional architecture in a common representational space. We characterized the structure of individual differences using three common functional indices, and assessed the reliability of this structure across independent samples of data in a natural vision paradigm. Hyperalignment markedly improved the reliability of individual differences across all three indices by resolving topographic idiosyncrasies and accommodating information encoded in spatially fine-grained response patterns. Our results demonstrate that substantial individual differences in cortical functional architecture exist at fine spatial scales, but are inaccessible with anatomical normalization alone.},
